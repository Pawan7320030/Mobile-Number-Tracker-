Mobile Number Tracker 
This Python script uses tkinter to build a GUI application for tracking mobile numbers. It imports modules like phonenumbers for parsing and retrieving phone number details such as country and SIM operator. It utilizes geopy for geocoding to fetch longitude and latitude, and pytz for determining the phone's time zone and displaying the current time. The interface includes buttons, labels, and images to enhance user interaction and display information effectively.
